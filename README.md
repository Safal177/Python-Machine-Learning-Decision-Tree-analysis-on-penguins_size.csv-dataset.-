Python Machine Learning (Decision Tree classification) analysis on “penguins_size.csv” dataset. 

Project Outline: 
This project shows my kills on decision tree classification on the “penguins_size.csv” dataset. It has an end-to-end machine leaning pipeline including data preprocessing, decision tree (model) training, evaluating models, and visualizing models. 

Dataset:
Data Source:  
•	Dataset was downloaded from https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv.
•	Data License: CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) public domain.

Key Targets:
•	Preprocess original data
•	Encoding categorical features
•	Make train and test splitting for decision tree classification.
•	Evaluate decision tree with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. 
•	Visualize response with confusion matrix, decision tree plot, and feature importance.

Tools Applied:
•	Python (Jupyter notebook)
•	NumPy
•	Pandas
•	Seaborn
•	Matplotlib
•	Scikit-learn

Results:
•	Accuracy (about 96%)
•	 Feature weighting:
